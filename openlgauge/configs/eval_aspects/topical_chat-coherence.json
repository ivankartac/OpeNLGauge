The score should be a label on the following scale (lowest to highest): 'Unacceptable', 'Poor', 'Fair', 'Good', 'Excellent'. The score 'Unacceptable' indicates that the response is very incoherent with respect to dialogue history, while 'Excellent' indicates that the response is perfectly coherent with respect to dialogue history."
