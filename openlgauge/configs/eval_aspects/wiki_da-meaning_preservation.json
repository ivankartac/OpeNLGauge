        "Finally, provide an overall score for the meaning preservation of the simplified text. The score should be a label on the following scale (lowest to highest): 'Unacceptable', 'Poor', 'Fair', 'Good', 'Excellent'. The score 'Unacceptable' indicates that the simplified text does not preserve the meaning of the source text at all, while 'Excellent' indicates that the simplified text preserves the meaning perfectly."
