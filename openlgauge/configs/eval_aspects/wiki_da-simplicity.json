The score should be a label on the following scale (lowest to highest): 'Unacceptable', 'Poor', 'Fair', 'Good', 'Excellent'. The score 'Unacceptable' indicates that the simplified text is harder to understand compared to the source text, while 'Excellent' indicates that the simplified text significantly easier to understand."
