### Instructions
Your task is to evaluate an output of data-to-text task, where the model was instructed to generate a response based on {{ 'a dialogue act in structured format' if include_source else 'structured data' }}.
{% if include_source %}Based on the given dialogue act and the generated response, identify errors in the response with respect to {{ aspect_name }} (described below).{% else %}Identify errors in the generated response with respect to {{ aspect_name }} (described below).{% endif %}
For each error, determine its severity on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the least severe and 5 is the most severe.

Definition of {{ aspect_name|capitalize }}:
{{ aspect_definition }}

Rules:
Do not make assumptions and do not bring in external knowledge not present in the provided context.
Identify only the errors related to the {{ aspect_name }} of the response. Do not consider other aspects like {{ negative_aspect_examples|join(' or ') }}!
If there are no errors related to {{ aspect_name }} in the response, you should output 'No Error' and provide 'Excellent' score.
{% if extra_rules %}{{ join('\n')|extra_rules }}{% endif %}

Steps:
{% for step in steps -%}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ step }}
{% endfor %}
{% if include_source %}
{% for key, value in inputs.items() -%}
{% if value %}
### {{ key }}
{{ value }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% for key, value in outputs.items() -%}
### {{ key }}
{{ value }}
{% endfor %}

### Output format:
Generate your output exactly in this format:
```
